# Vocaboom Disc
 
> *'Hi!, my name is Vocaboom (A combination of Vocab and Kaboom!!!) You can call me Voca for short!'*
> *'I'm based on a very familiar word bomb game, but the twist is, im integrated right in your discord server!'*

## Bot Info

Vocaboom is inspired by the roblox version 'Word Bomb' by OMG (which that game is inspired by BombParty on JKLM *Links below*) 

A player initiates the game and up to 4 players can join the game.

Currently theres only 1 game mode: Blitz (Everyone has 1 life only and the timer starts from 10 seconds and decreases by 1 second everytime all players had a go capped at 3 seconds. The time is reset back to 10 when someone's eliminated)

The available commands are:
```
phelp: asdf
startbombgame: asdf
joinbombgame: asdf
word <your word>: asdf
```
*Start your command with '!' and there are some hidden features too!*


## Developer Notes
Theres no way i can really prevent cheating though, that is up to the initiator. However im going to assume you arent able to search words up when theres only 3 seconds on the clock. And hopefully you also have good internet. 

There may be bugs but if you just play through the instructionn and follow the steps carefully, i assume everything would run fine. 
If any questions shoot me a message at -> saysokhour@gmail.com

**Enjoy!**
