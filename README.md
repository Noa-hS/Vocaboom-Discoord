# Vocaboom Disc
 
'Hi!, my name is Vocaboom (A combination of Vocab and Kaboom!!!) You can call me Voca for short!'
'I'm based on a very familiar word bomb game, but the twist is, im integrated right in your discord server!'

Vocaboom is inspired by the roblox version 'Word Bomb' 

A player initiates the game and up to 4 players can join the game.

Currently theres only 1 game mode: Blitz (Everyone has 1 life only and the timer starts from 10 seconds and decreases by 1 second everytime all players had a go capped at 3 seconds. The time is reset back to 10 when someone's eliminated)

Theres no way i can really prevent cheating though, that is up to the initiator. However im going to assume you arent able to search words up when theres only 3 seconds on the clock. And hopefully you also have good internet. 

There may be bugs but if you just play through the instructtionn and follow the steps carefully, i assume everything would run fine. 
If any questions shoot me a message at -> @saysokhour@gmail.com

Enjoy!
